\section{Overview}
In 15440 project 3, we are going to implement a robust solution for
echo server model. The echo client will send to echo manager some echo messages
, upon receiving the echo message, the echo manager will log the message and 
dispatch request to a backend echo server, the echo server will store the echo 
message to a log file, then send identical message back to client. The feautres of the 
system will be described in detail in following sections. 

The reason why we choose to implement a echo server is that
we want to focus our energy on designning and implementing a reliable solution
for distributed system rather than spending too much on application level logic. 
Since most of the distributed
application can be abstracted as echo server like model, which involving
sending, receiving message and/or sharing state among multiple nodes. We 
can easily extend this project into reliable application, such as 
ticket reservation system, online game, etc.

\section{Features}
\subsection{Record Log}
We will use log to record all the request information on echo server side. Echo log
entry will keep meta data, such as where and when the request is received. The log can
be extended to support features like redo or undo operation. The log can also be used
for user to analysis the situation.

\subsection{Job Partition}
The echo manager will dispatch work for all the echo servers. We will use hash ring
method to register newly joined echo server. Echo manager will also dispatch work to each echo server. 
The method will garanteed that all the loads among echo server is rougly balanced.

\subsection{Data Replication}
The data replication is the most important feature we are going to implement for this 
project. In second tier, we are going to implement the primary backup mechnism for the
echo servers, the echo manager will act as failure detector for all the echo servers. 
To make life easier, we will assume the echo manager never fail. In third tier, we will
try our best to implement a robust paxos solution to replace the primary backup mechnism. 

\section{General Design}
The whole system will be developed with Go programming language on Linux 
environment. We mainly divide our work into 3 tiers, each tier will be based on 
previously work. The first tier will implement the most core and basic function 
and the last tier will implement more ``advanced'' function which is able to 
deal with more complicate situation.

\subsection{First Tier}
The first tier will have one echo client, one echo manager and one echo server. The
echo server will record all the request information into log file. This is the
easiest part to implement.

\center{\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{2.png}}
\caption{First Tier}
\label{fig:speciation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Second Tier}
The second tier will support multiple echo clients and multiple echo servers. 
We will add feature to enable echo manager to uniformly dispatch the work 
to all the echo server. The echo manager will also need to response appropriately 
to echo server join. An important feature added to this tier is primary backup mechnism.
The echo manager will act as central server to detect failure and manage replication
among the echo servers.

\label{fig:speciation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Third Tier}
Based on the previous tiers of work, the third tier will further support 
replication by replacing the primary backup with a more sophiscated paxos protocal. 
we will try our best to implement a simple paxos protocal. To garanteed the 
correctness of paxos, we will also develop testcases during development.

\section{Test Plan}
In this project, we have 3 relatively independent component, echo client, 
echo manager and echo server. We will mainly test echo manager and echo
server. The diffcult part is to test the replication feature.

\subsection{Functional Test}
The functional test will test each component independently. The functional test 
will try to cover each function in every component. Given certain input, check
whether it response with expceted result.

\subsection{Integration Test}
The integration test is to test all the components as whole system. Replication,
dynamic node join will be the key point to test. We will explicitly kill echo server
and monitor the whole system status information to make sure everything goes well.
With robust replication scheme, the whole system should be able to cope with limited
number of echo server failures.

\subsection{Stress Test}
In the stress test, we will create as many echo client as possible to test
the limit of the whole system. During testing, we will create different number 
of echo client and server. The echo client will constantly sending random 
generated message, and we will also random kill ``some'' given number of echo
server.

\section{Evalutation}
Our system should support many echo clients working simultenously and   
making progress. There are several point to evaluate. We will develop testcases
for each of these points.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Echo server will record all the request from client into a log file. 
  \item Echo manager will dispatch the request to different echo server. The 
    load should be balanced among all existed echo servers.
  \item Echo Manger should be able to detect the failure of echo server.
  \item Newly registered echo server should be able to appropriate join the system.
  \item The echo server should support replication. 
  \item The echo server should keep on working with limited number peers failed.
\end{enumerate}
